# Spotify Advanced SQL Project and Query Optimization

## Overview
This project focuses on the practical application of advanced SQL skills in the context of a Spotify dataset. The workflow encompasses database normalization, complex query development, and rigorous query optimization. The objective is to demonstrate proficiency in data manipulation and analysis, deriving actionable insights from a large-scale dataset.


## Project Steps

### 1. Data Exploration
Before diving into SQL, itâ€™s important to understand the dataset thoroughly. The dataset contains attributes such as:
- `Artist`: The performer of the track.
- `Track`: The name of the song.
- `Album`: The album to which the track belongs.
- `Album_type`: The type of album (e.g., single or album).
- Various metrics such as `danceability`, `energy`, `loudness`, `tempo`, and more.

### 4. Querying the Data
After the data is inserted, various SQL queries can be written to explore and analyze the data. Queries are categorized into "Level 1", "Level 1", "Level 3".

#### Level 1 Queries
- Simple data retrieval, filtering, and basic aggregations.
  
#### Level 2 Queries
- More complex queries involving grouping, aggregation functions, and joins.
  
#### Level 3 Queries
- Nested subqueries, window functions, CTEs, and performance optimization.
